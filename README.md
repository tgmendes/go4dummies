# An intro to Golang
## Introduction
With all it's greatness and simplicity, Golang also has it's quirks and particularities.

This repo showcases different, fundamental, aspects of Go, tied up with a presentation made with Go present.

It contains the following main sections:

* Small demonstration of Go's strong points
* Brief intro on how Go works
* Showcase of small quirks
* A practical example with a client, a crawler, handlers, and a server.

## What it is, what it isn't
The primary goal of this repo was to serve as a basis for talks and presentations.

It does not represent a full detailed guid on doing things.

This means it can contain code that is not that clean or consistent, and that the project layout is not ideal.

## Using it
### Viewing the slides
* Install [Present](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present) (you can follow [this](https://halyph.com/blog/2015/05/18/golang-presentation-tool.html) intuitive and clear blog post).
* Run the `present` command within the present folder.
* Visit the URL displayed in the command line.

### The Code
All the code contained in the repo should work, with tests passing. You can just browse it and use it for your needs.
