* What is test driven development?

- Write tests *before* implementation code
- Automated
- Run quickly and often
- Unit tests, integration tests, any kind of tests

* Why test-driven development?

- Evidence based programming
- Prove bugs or missing features
- Demonstrate the intent
- Protected from regression
- Tests become your only promise
- Write tests for each other
- Code becomes documentation
- Get it out of your brain
- Be your own user first

* Simple process

- Write a unit test
- Run all tests to ensure your new one fails (RED)
- Write the **smallest* amount of code needed to make your test pass
- Run your tests and see it pass (GREEN)
- Run all your tests to make sure you haven't broken anything
- Commit?
